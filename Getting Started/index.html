        <p>Dogs have four legs, usually. They have an acute sense of smell, and a seeming 
            fondness for humans, although it is unclear if this affection is born out of 
            a genuine emotional response, or based on human brainwashing. </p>
        <p>Dogs are descended from wolves, which are vicious creatures that work in small
            familial groups to murder large game incuding: deer, bison, caribou, small children, 
            and occultists. Dogs however are generally pretty chill, and can be easily plyed 
            with peanut butter. </p>
